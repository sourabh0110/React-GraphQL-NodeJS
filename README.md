## Day 1 Contents

Disadvantages of using console API Overview of the Chrome Developer Tools Debugging JS using the Chrome Developer Tools Developer Tools in other browsers

Single-threaded nature of JavaScript The Event Loop and event handling Synchronous (blocking) and Asynchronous (non-blocking) methods

Block-level scoping and the use of let, const - const

- let - var - nothing

```
    const myvar = "hello;
    let myvar = "hello;
    var myvar = "hello;
    myvar = "hello; -> window.myvar = "hello;
```

Template strings Default Parameters Object and Array Destructuring Rest and spread operators (includes object spread), making immutable changes, deep and shallow copies of objects Arrow Functions Classes, Class Inheritance Modules Promises async…await

Kafka & how esb is used

Cloud - aws azure Containarization - docker

prefer not using log
instead we can use debugger
browers (chrome)
code

````
function doSomething() {
console.log("One");
console.log("two");

    fetch(
            "http://yoursite.com/application/uri/resource",
        (data) => {document.getElementById("mydiv").innerHTML = data})

    console.log("Four");
    ```

}
es6 content
```
function myfunction(val) {this.val = val}
// this is anonymous function + this cannot hold the referece of this
let myfunction = (val) => {this.val this does not work (x)}
a function inside a function is called closure
-- named closured
function one() {
// variables which are declared here are accessable to two () +
// since its a function its only loaded
function two() {}

        two();
    }
    let oneRef = one();


    --


    function one(val1) {
        return function(val2) {
            return val1 + val2;
        }
    }

    ```

callback
promise
error first approach

Generators
```
let arr = [32,5,6,8,9,02,1];

    for(let i=0;i< arr.length; i++) {
        console.log(i)
    }

    ---
    arr.forEach((val) => console.log(val));
    -- fibonacci series
    let val = yeild currVal;
    [currVal, nextVal] = [nextVal, nextVal + currVal];

show dbs

use sap_db; (if the db is not created the it will create)

let emp={empName:'hitesh', empsal:1234} db.emps.insert(emp);

db.emps.insert({empName:'hitesh', empsal:1234});

db.emps.insert({empName:'Rohit', empsal:2233});

db.emps.insert({empName:'Madhulata', empsal:2233, email:"madhulatha@gmail.com"});

show collections; -- to show all the collections in the DB

db.emps.find({}); - select \* from emps;

db.emps.find({selector , projection - 1 or 0 });

db.emps.find({empName:'hitesh'})

db.emps.find({empsal:{$gt:2000}})

mongoimport --host localhost --db sap_db --collection emps --file ./emps.json

mongoexport --db sap_db --host localhost --collection emps --out=exp-emps.json

db.emps.find({email:{$exists:false}})

-- find people who salary is more than 2000 and should not have email

db.emps.find( { empsal:{$gt:2000}, email:{$exists:false} }, { \_id:0, empName:1, empsal:1 } );

}
to iterate records and copy to other collection
new collection new_emps should have only name and salary

var cursor1=db.emps.find({}, {\_id:0, empName:1, empsal:1});
while(cursor1.hasNext()) {
let record = cursor1.next();
db.new_emps.insert({empname:record.empName.toUpperCase(), salary:record.empsal});
}
db.createCollection("collName", options)

db.createCollection("capCol", {capped:true, autoIndexId:true, size:1000, max:5})

db.emps.update({empName:"hitesh"}, {$set:{empName:"Hitesh Patil", email:"hitesh@ps.com"}})
